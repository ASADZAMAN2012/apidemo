### Base framework with cypress - testing with api demo for https://reqres.in

This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) testing. The application uses every API command in Cypress for demonstration purposes. Additionally this example will run on Circle CI.

## https://reqres.in
https://reqres.in is a demo website where people can try out the API test. In this project, I have created test cases on the that would get the user list, post the users, delete the users and validate all response via Cypress tool, and used to test e2e use cases for the same. This will run test in CircleCI and also creates simple mochawesome report. 

## Use Cases
Fetch Users
Add New Users
Edit Users
Delete Users
